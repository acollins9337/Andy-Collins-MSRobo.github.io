                        <h3>ROS2 Autonomous Maze Solver</h3>
                        <p>
                            I spent some time working with a partner on a software package to solve a simple maze. 
                            The maze was constructed such that signs on the walls pointed the way to the goal, 
                            and were key to solving the maze. Aditya and I created a ROS2/Python package to solve 
                            the maze by using machine learning to predict what the signs are, and then traveling to 
                            waypoints using ROS2 NAV2. Our final submission achieved 90% sign classification accuracy, 
                            and was able to complete the maze properly and without error in 5/6 tests.

                        <h3>CIP Skid</h3>
                        <p>
                            I worked with a team of seven other Clemson ME students to design a Clean-In-Place Skid system to 
                            specifications laid out by the Fluor Corporation. I focused heavily on the conceptual design side of the project, 
                            doing much of my work in the areas of CAD design, flow and heat calculations, and equipment purchasing. 
                            I also acted as the Group Liason, ensuring useful and professional communcation with the sponsors at Fluor, 
                            the advisors at Clemson, and any suppliers we spoke with.
